# Quantum Bookstore

**Quantum Bookstore** is a Java console-based application that simulates a simple and extensible online bookstore.  
This project was developed as part of the **Fawry Full Stack Internship** qualification tasks.

## Features

âœ… Add books to inventory (PaperBook, EBook, ShowcaseBook)  
âœ… Buy books using ISBN  
âœ… Remove outdated books based on publishing year  
âœ… Handle purchase logic (reduce stock, validate type)  
âœ… Simulate delivery (ShippingService / MailService)  
âœ… Extensible architecture for new book types  

## Book Types

| Type          | Description                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ðŸ“˜ PaperBook   | Physical book with stock quantity and shipping   |
| ðŸ“— EBook       | Electronic book with file type, sent by email    |
| ðŸ“• ShowcaseBook| Not for sale, used for display/demo purposes     |

## How It Works

- **Add Book:** Add any type of book to the inventory with `ISBN`, `Title`, `Author`, `Year`, and `Price`.
- **Buy Book:** Buy using the ISBN and quantity. 
  - If PaperBook â†’ simulates shipping.
  - If EBook â†’ simulates email delivery.
  - If ShowcaseBook â†’ throws error: "Book not for sale".
- **Remove Outdated:** Removes books older than given number of years.

## Example Usage

```java
Inventory inv = new Inventory();

inv.addBook(new PaperBook("101", "Python Course", "Ali", 2012, 150.0, 3));
inv.addBook(new EBook("202", "Clean Code", "Shahd", 2020, 200.0, "PDF"));
inv.addBook(new ShowcaseBook("303", "Java Course", "Unknown", 1946, 0.0));

inv.buyBook("101", 2, "y@y.com", "6 October City");
inv.buyBook("202", 1, "s@s.com", "");

try {
    inv.buyBook("303", 1, "g@g.com", "Nowhere");
} catch (Exception ex) {
    System.out.println("Quantum book store : Error: " + ex.getMessage());
}

inv.removeOutdated(10);
